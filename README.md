# Results

This directory contains outputs generated by analysis scripts.

**Note**: Most files in this directory are not tracked in git. 
They can be regenerated by running the analysis pipeline.

## Manuscript Figures and Tables

The final manuscript includes **5 figures** and **4 tables**:

| Output | Description | Source Folder |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Fig 1 | Major miRNA composition by sample | `01_compositional/` |
| Fig 2 | Major miRNA mean fractional abundance | `01_compositional/` |
| Fig 3 | Major miRNAs with significant treatment differences | `01_compositional/` |
| Fig 4 | miRNA target overlap summary (4 panels) | `04_pathway/major/stringent/` |
| Fig 5 | CF-relevant pathway categories | `04_pathway/` |
| Table 1 | Pathway category summary | `04_pathway/` |
| Tables 2-3 | Convergent genes (inflammation, remodeling) | `04_pathway/major/stringent/` |
| Table 4 | CF-relevant miRNAs in hMSC EV cargo | `02_minor_miRNA/` |

## Directory Structure

Subdirectories mirror the `analysis/` structure:

- `00_data_prep/` — Processed count data
- `01_compositional/` — Compositional analysis outputs (Figs 1-3)
- `02_minor_miRNA/` — Minor miRNA prevalence analysis (Table 4)
- `03_deseq2/` — DESeq2 differential expression (exploratory; not in manuscript)
- `04_pathway/` — Pathway enrichment outputs (Figs 4-5, Tables 1-3)

## Regenerating Results

To regenerate all manuscript figures and tables:

```r
# From project root
source(here("run_all.R"))
```

Or run individual analyses:

```r
# Compositional analysis (Figs 1-3)
rmarkdown::render(here("analysis", "01_compositional", "CompositionalAnalysis.Rmd"))

# Minor miRNA analysis (Table 4)
rmarkdown::render(here("analysis", "02_minor_miRNA", "MinorMiRNA_Prevalence_Analysis.Rmd"))

# Pathway analysis (Figs 4-5, Tables 1-3)
source(here("analysis", "04_pathway", "analyze_mirna_target_overlap.R"))
source(here("analysis", "04_pathway", "categorize_pathways.R"))
```

## Creating Submission Archive

```r
source(here("archive_for_submission.R"))
```

This creates a dated zip file with all manuscript figures and tables.
