miRNA,Impact,Key_Mechanism
miR-145-5p,Harmful,"Targets CFTR 3'UTR; suppresses SMAD3 ~30-40%; TGF-β recruits to RISC to destabilize CFTR mRNA; anti-miR-145 enhanced modulator efficacy >50%"
miR-223-3p,Harmful,"Targets CFTR 3'UTR; upregulated in CF leukocytes (-3p is dominant strand, 10x more abundant than -5p)"
miR-494-5p,Harmful,"Targets CFTR 3'UTR; synergistic with miR-101 producing ~80% CFTR repression; suppresses ATF6"
miR-509-3p,Harmful,"Explicitly -3p in literature; targets CFTR 3'UTR"
miR-101-3p,Harmful,"Targets CFTR 3'UTR; synergistic with miR-494 (-3p is dominant strand, 10x more abundant than -5p)"
miR-17-5p,Harmful,"Mir17-92 cluster; suppresses autophagy in CF macrophages; antagomir reduced lung bacterial burden ~50%"
miR-181b-5p,Harmful,"Impairs ALX/FPR2-dependent phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa; anti-miR-181b normalized clearance"
miR-155-5p,Harmful,"Elevated >5-fold in CF; pro-fibrotic via RPTOR/TGF-β/SMAD2/CTGF cascade; drives IL-8 via SHIP1/PI3K/Akt"
miR-221-5p,Harmful,"Suppresses ATF6; contributes to ER stress dysregulation in CF"
miR-143-5p,Harmful,"TGF-β recruited to RISC; destabilizes CFTR mRNA; nullifies modulator therapy"
miR-138-5p,Beneficial,"Mimics rescued ΔF508-CFTR chloride transport (ΔIt ~60-80 μA/cm²); therapeutic potential"
miR-29b-1-5p,Beneficial,"Anti-fibrotic; targets TGF-β/Smad3 signaling"
miR-29b-2-5p,Beneficial,"Anti-fibrotic; targets TGF-β/Smad3 signaling (same mature sequence as miR-29b-1-5p)"
miR-125b-5p,Beneficial,"Anti-fibrotic (TGFβ1-EMT/BAK1); protects against lung injury"
miR-27b-3p,Beneficial,"Antifibrotic (AP/LOXL2); positively correlated with FEV1 during exacerbation"
miR-199a-3p,Beneficial,"When present, provides inhibitory control over NF-κB; downregulation removes this brake on inflammation"
miR-199a-5p,Mixed,"Targets CAV1/TLR4; reduction may decrease inflammation but also affect infection clearance"
miR-885-3p,Mixed,"Anti-inflammatory (TLR4/NF-κB); may impair Gram-negative bacterial detection"
miR-760,Mixed,"Anti-ferroptosis via CHAC1; may promote IL-8/CCL2; also reduces TLR4 signaling"
miR-424-5p,Beneficial,"Targets Smad3/TGF-β signaling; anti-fibrotic"
